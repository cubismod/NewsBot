        summary: "'Games are being played to silence us,' Philip Van Cleave of the Virginia Citizens Defense League complained in an email sent Tuesday to his members. 'This was a thinly veiled effort to lock us out,' Van Cleave told the Washington Post. He had called Virginia's Department of General Services last week to obtain a permit for a second big rally on Richmond's Capitol Square on January 18, but was dismayed to discover that the only time slots available that day were at 6 AM or at 6 PM. His dismay turned to fury when he discovered that the other time slots all had been booked by pro-gun-control groups.",
